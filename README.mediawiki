=== KinderThek - A german Plex media channel for kids  ===

''What can this channel do for you?''
This channel streams content for kids from several german media websites directly to your plex devices.
The content depends on published and parsable clips from each site.

=== Donation ===
Since I'm developing in my free time I'd like to ask you to support my work.
You can do it by contributing 5 EUR via paypal. This will give me motivation
to keep on coding and fixing bugs.

Thanks in advance
